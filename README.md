Hi Humans!

Abhinav here.
Entrepreneurship is messy.

Startup life is messy.

Growing a business is messy.

I guarantee you it NEVER looks as glamorous on the inside as it does from the outside.

If you are comparing what is going on in your company to what you see your peers and competitors doing, and feel behind or inadequate, or in any way not up to par.....

Just let it go. You have no idea what they are going through that you cannot see. You never will. You don't need to.

Take a deep breath. Stay on your path. Stay focused on your mission. Stay focused on your customers. Stay focused on your team. Your family. Your health. Find connection and joy in your own journey.

Allow yourself to be inspired and fueled by others' success, but by all means, do not allow yourself to get derailed or thrown off of your path. Stay focused.
